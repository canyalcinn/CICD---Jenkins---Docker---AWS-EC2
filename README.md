After receiving my AWS certificates, I decided to learn the necessary tools for devops (DevOps was the next thing to learn since I enjoyed very much).

While I was looking for a CI/CD project where I could use both Jenkins and Dockers and create a CICD pipeline, I was interested in the GitHub repository linked below:

https://github.com/mudasirhaji/CI-CD-Jenkins

The things I practiced for the real life:

- Continuous Integration: by utilizing Jenkins as a Continuous Integration tool to automatically build and test the application every time code changes are made.

- Continuous Delivery/Deployment: by using use Jenkins to automatically deploy the application to a server or Docker registry when the build and test phases are successful, ensuring that the latest version of our application is always available to end-users.

- Continuous Testing: The app is continuously tested while the Docker image is run as part of the pipeline process, helping to identify any issues early in the development cycle.

- Infrastructure as Code: by leveraging Jenkins pipeline scripting to automate the build, test, and deployment process of our application (IaC is a real magic, I totally focused on that area to be a real DevOps Pro).

- Webhook Triggers: by setting up webhook triggers to automatically trigger pipeline builds whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.

- Docker: by containerizing our application using Docker to make it more portable and scalable (This is a another magic. I was hesitant about learning containerization. This project gave me 100% confidence in using docker and understanding the full logic. "Docker allows us to package our application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit that can be run consistently on any platform").

- GIT: using Git to manage the source code of our application, making it easier to collaborate and version-control changes.
